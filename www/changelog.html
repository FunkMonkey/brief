                    <h3>Brief is now compatible with Firefox 4</h3>
                    <h3>Major changes to the user interface:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More web-like look and feel. Toolbars, buttons, and the other parts of the interface no longer use the native look of Firefox's theme.</li>
                        <li><strong>All items</strong> folder at the top of the sidebar.</li>
                        <li>Feeds are not paginated, items are loaded as the user scrolls down ("infinite scrolling").</li>
                        <li>Rearranged and simplified toolbar:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The buttons and the feed title form a single bar.</li>
                                <li>View Unread and View Bookmarks drop-down menu removed in favour of separate buttons.</li>
                                <li>Search bar moved to a more natural position on the far right, above the feed view which it filters.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>New shortcuts to mark all items on the screen as read (<strong>N</strong>)
                            and to quickly scroll up or down by 10 items (<strong>I</strong> and <strong>U</strong>).
                        <li>New first run page. A default feeds folder is created automatically.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Other changes and improvements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Firefox 4 the number of unread items can be shown on the toolbar button, now that the status bar is gone.</li>
                        <li>Some keyboard shortcuts have been rearranged.</li>
                        <li>Items are opened in new tabs by default.</li>
                        <li>Reorganized options window.</li>
                        <li>Brief's toolbar button doesn't stay pressed when Brief's tab is selected.</li>
                        <li>Unread items counter has been removed from the Trash folder.</li>
                        <li>Feed favicons are periodically refreshed, in case they have changed.</li>
                        <li>When Bookmarks folder is selected, the list of tags is shown in a separate column to the right.</li>
                        <li>Items opened in new tabs are treated as related to Brief's tab (i.e. be opened next to it)</li>
                        <li>Checking feeds for updates has been improved, so that it doesn't slow down the browser.</li>
                        <li>"Open items in new tabs" option always creates new tabs, not windows, regardless of Firefox's general options</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Fixed bugs:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sliding notification of new items doesn't work</li>
                        <li>Favicon goes blank while a feed is being updated (no throbber).</li>
                        <li>Status bar tooltip is empty in French and Spanish versions (thanks to el.Fakir for the patch!).</li>
                        <li>Feed items aren't deleted properly when Trash is emptied and keep taking up space on disk.</li>
                        <li>Feeds that have their own update interval specified are sometimes refreshed every minute.</li>
                        <li>Sometimes feed refreshing gets stuck and fails to finish.</li>
                        <li>Tearing Brief's tab off to a new window causes feed items to be opened in tabs in the old window.</li>
                        <li>Feed goes blank if it contains script using document.writeln.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Brief is now compatible with Firefox 3.6.</h3>
                    <h3>Improvements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a feed contains errors, Brief will try to retrieve as many items as possible instead of ignoring it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Fixed bugs:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Items with the same date aren't displayed in the order in which they appear in the feed.</li>
                        <li>Regression: unread items count no longer shown when a folder is closed.</li>
                        <li>Regression: some feeds with invalid dates get stuck loading indefinitely.</li>

                        <li>Sort direction isn't updated when switching between All and Unread views (when "Sort oldest items first in unread view" turned on).</li>

                    </h3>
                    <h3>New features and improvements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integration with the new bookmarks system in Firefox 3: starred items are now simply bookmarks.
                            The star in the left corner of an item brings up Edit Bookmark panel, just like the one in the Location Bar.
                            You can browse and search items by their tags.</li>
                        <li>Improved performance. Switching pages and deleting items is a lot faster.</li>
                        <li>Optimized checking feeds for updates, doesn't lock up Firefox anymore.</li>
                        <li>Searching faster, matches only full words and provides Google-like syntax, for example: mozilla OR "firefox extension" -tabs.</li>
                        <li>Search matches are highlighted in the feed content.</li>
                        <li>New way of customizing appearance of feeds. You no longer have to provide a complete replacement for the
                            default CSS style, instead you can add rules in addition to the default style. There is a simple built-in
                            editor available in the Options window.</li>
                        <li>A feed-specific setting not to mark changed items back as unread.</li>
                        <li>Reorganized Options window.</li>
                        <li>Option to sort oldest items first in unread view.</li>
                        <li>Tweaks to the default style of feeds.</li>
                        <li>Option to always highlight the current item, so that you can edit it using keyboard shortcuts.</li>
                        <li>Spacebar/backspace always scroll to the next/previous item.</li>
                        <li>Shortucts to show next/previous item (K/J) were swapped to match the common layout among most applications.</li>
                        <li>You can hold Ctrl when clicking "Mark all items as read" button to mark only the current page.</li>
                        <li>When a web page is displayed, clicking the currently selected feed in the sidebar restores the feed view.</li>
                        <li>Keyboard shortcut to open Brief: <em>Ctrl + Shift + A</em>.</li>
                        <li>The feed-specific setting to specify the maximum number of stored items was removed. The global option is
                            still available. See <a href="http://brief.mozdev.org/drupal/node/166">this topic</a> for background.</li>
                        <li>When an item has no title, the URL is shown as the title.</li>
                        <li>Network security dialogs, for example warnings about invalid certificates, are suppressed to avoid annoying
                            users. This also includes authentication prompts, so if you subscribe to authenticated feeds, you can flip
                            a hidden preference to restore the old behaviour: <em>extensions.brief.update.suppressSecurityDialogs</em>.</li>
                        <li>Progress bar is always shown when checking feeds for updates, instead of only when it was manually initiated by the user.</li>
                        <li>Spinbuttons (these tiny arrows) were added to textboxes in options for entering numbers.</li>
                        <li>Smooth scrolling was tweaked, so that it doesn't take too much time to scroll past long items.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Fixed bugs:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brief works better with NoScript extension. You no longer have to add all file:// URLs to the whitelist, Brief has its own resource:// URL.</li>
                        <li>OPML importing was significantly improved. Brief handles more kinds of files and deals with errors better (thanks to DG for providing samples of various problematic OMPL files).</li>
                        <li>Exceptions in the Error Console when the sidebar is hidden.</li>
                        <li>Double-clicking Mark Read button in the Unread view results in infinite stream of exceptions in the Error Console (thanks to Ngamer for reporting)</li>
                        <li>After opening an item in unread view and then going back, marking items as read doesn't work anymore</li>
                        <li>Firefox's shortcut for switching tabs (Ctrl+Tab) accidentally toggles highlighting of the current item.</li>
                        <li>In headlines view, when unfolding an item taller than the window height, the scroll position lines up with the bottom of the item instead of the top</li>
                        <li>Sometimes feeds are skipped when updating multiple feeds.</li>
                        <li>Feed content flickers when refreshed.</li>
                        <li>Favicons in the list of feeds sometimes are mixed up.</li>
                        <li>Contents of items are now a displayed like any normal elements in web pages, which fixes various things
                            that didn't with the special way Brief used to serve the contents. This includes tooltips (floating titles
                            of elements), Firefox extensions that interact with contents of web pages, and potentially some other stuff.</li>

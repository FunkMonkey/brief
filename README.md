Brief
=====

[Brief] [1] is a feed reading extension for Mozilla Firefox, released under the [MPL 1.1].

Currently without official support, with the stable version (1.5.4) [not being compatible] [2] anymore with the latest Firefox releases, and the version 1.6 (beta)
not being the cup of tea for everyone, some guys are trying to do something about it.


This project
------------

In short: Brief 1.5.4 made compatible with the latest Firefox releases. It doesn't work as a separated add-on, it's an update.

It's shared under the [MPL 2.0].

The latest work is in the branch "dev-1.5". While branches centred on the source code of the version 1.6 of Brief are available too, they are barely developed. "BRIEF_1_6_BRANCH" was taken over from CVS repo, but is not up to date.
